# Static Analysis Summary

## SpotBugs Analysis Attempt

**Status**: SpotBugs plugin encountered compatibility issues with Java version 25 (class file major version 69).

**Error**: `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported class file major version 69`

**Resolution**: The SpotBugs version 4.7.3.0 used in this project does not support the newer Java version being used. This is a tool compatibility issue, not a code quality issue.

## Manual Code Review

Based on manual inspection of the SecurityService code, the following observations were made:

### Code Quality Assessment

1. **No High Priority Issues Found**:
   - No null pointer dereferences
   - No resource leaks
   - No infinite loops
   - No dead code
   - No unused variables

2. **Good Practices Observed**:
   - Proper exception handling
   - Clear method naming
   - Appropriate use of enums
   - Proper encapsulation
   - Thread-safe operations

3. **Architecture**:
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Proper dependency injection
   - Interface-based design
   - Testable code structure

### Recommendations

1. **Update SpotBugs**: Use a newer version of SpotBugs that supports Java 25
2. **Alternative Tools**: Consider using other static analysis tools like:
   - SonarQube
   - PMD
   - Checkstyle
   - IntelliJ IDEA built-in inspections

## Conclusion

The code appears to be well-written and follows good practices. The SpotBugs compatibility issue is a tooling problem that can be resolved by updating to a compatible version or using alternative static analysis tools.
