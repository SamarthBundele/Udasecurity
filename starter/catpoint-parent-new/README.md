# CatPoint Security System - Multi-Module Project

This project has been successfully split into a multi-module Maven structure to separate the Image Service from the Security Service.

## Project Structure

```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Module Separation
- **Image Module**: Contains all image recognition services (AWS and Fake implementations)
- **Security Module**: Contains the main application, GUI, data models, and security logic

### 2. Dependency Management
- **Parent POM**: Manages shared dependencies and plugin versions using `dependencyManagement` and `pluginManagement`
- **Child POMs**: Only declare dependencies they actually need
- **No Duplicate Dependencies**: Each dependency is declared only where it's used

### 3. Package Structure Updates
- Image services moved to `com.udacity.catpoint.image` package
- Security components moved to `com.udacity.catpoint.security.*` packages
- Proper separation of concerns between modules

### 4. Interface-Based Design
- Created `ImageService` interface for better abstraction
- Security module depends on the interface, not concrete implementations
- Enables easy swapping of image service implementations

## Dependencies by Module

### Parent POM (Shared)
- SLF4J API & Simple (logging)
- JUnit 5 (testing)
- Google Guava & Gson (utilities)
- AWS SDK (image recognition)
- MigLayout (GUI layout)

### Image Module
- SLF4J (logging)
- AWS SDK for Rekognition (image analysis)

### Security Module  
- Image module (dependency)
- Google Guava & Gson (utilities)
- MigLayout (GUI layout)
- SLF4J (logging)

## Building and Running

### Build All Modules
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Run the Application
```bash
cd Security
mvn exec:java
```

### Run Tests
```bash
mvn test
```

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Modularity**: Image service can be used independently by other projects
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Reusability**: Image module can be packaged and distributed separately
4. **Dependency Management**: No duplicate dependencies, proper version management
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new modules or services

## Future Enhancements

- Add module-info.java files when all dependencies support Java modules
- Create additional image service implementations
- Add integration tests between modules
- Package image module for distribution to other teams
